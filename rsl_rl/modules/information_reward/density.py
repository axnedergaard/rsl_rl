    A base class representing a loose abstraction of a density function on a space on a manifold.

    that can extend it. The methods provided serve as a common interface for density estimation, including
    functionality to compute the probability density function (pdf), sample from the density, generate random walks,
    compute entropy and learn the density from given states.
